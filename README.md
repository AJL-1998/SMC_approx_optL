Code accompanying the paper 

# Increasing the efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers through the use of near-optimal L-kernels 
# P. L. Green, R. E. Moore, R. J. Jackson, J. Li, S. Maskell
# University of Liverpool

## Code structure 

Code accompanying the first submission of the paper is in the branch 'v1' and can be accessed using `git checkout v1`. We are keeping the master branch separate so that we can use it to bring in future developments if needed.

The examples in the paper can be replicated by running code in the folder `toy_problems`.

## Using the code
If you would like to use the code, it would be really useful if did so by forking the current repository. This just gives us a way of seeing how the code is being used etc. 

## Testing
During development we made a series of tests for verification purposes. To execute the tests install `pytest` and run it in the `tests` folder. 

## Contributions
We actively encourage people to contribute to our code. If you would like to do so, please fork the repository and issue a pull request. We try to write everything in PEP8 notation - the file `PEP8_test.py` will automatically test the notation of all python files in the repository. If you find any problems, please feel free to raise an `issue` through Github and we'll do our best to get back to you.
